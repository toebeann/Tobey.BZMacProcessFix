# Tobey's macOS Process Fix for Subnautica: Below Zero

A BepInEx patcher which allows BepInEx plugins with the process filter "SubnauticaZero" to load on macOS - it is finally possible for macOS users to run QModManager! 

## Usage

Just download the .zip from [the releases page](https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.BZMacProcessFix/releases) and plop it in your Subnautica: Below Zero game folder (after installing [Tobey's BepInEx Pack for Subnautica: Below Zero](https://github.com/toebeann/BepInEx.SubnauticaZero), of course) - no configuration needed!
